CALL FOR PAPERS
---------------------------------

4 page submissions due by May 26th, 2022

Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are
powerful tools in data mining and knowledge discovery in
healthcare. There is a wide array of use-cases that range from
the analysis of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and drug
discovery to digital pathology and the analysis of
high-throughput sequencing data.  However, a wider uptake of
AI/ML systems by practitioners, especially in a clinical
environment such as Clinical Decision Support System, is slowed
down by a distinct set of requirements.  These include a need
for a stringent evaluation of AI/ML systems not only in terms of
safety of intended use of these algorithms and the ability to
account for and communicate uncertainty. In addition, both
regulatory and the clinical practitioners need transparency of
the AI/ML enabled systems, including considering usability
factors during development, reliability of the deployment,
interpretability of the AI/ML models, which overall calls for a
human-centred approach for the assurance of safety and
effectiveness have been proving challenging.  More specifically,
we plan to attract high-quality original research from emerging
areas with significant implications in healthcare and invite
open discussions on controversial yet crucial topics regarding
healthcare transformation.

We invite full papers, as well as work-in-progress on the application of data science in healthcare. Topics may include, but not limited to, the following topics (For more information see workshop webpage) with special focus on papers on transparent and human-centered AI in healthcare.
â€¨

* Human-in-the-loop-learning and human-centered AI
* Demos of practical applications of interpretable AI
* User driven interpretable AI in Healthcare
* Uncertainty quantification and communication, e.g. out-of-distribution detection
* Domain generalization and adaptation, e.g. multi-site studies
* Data access, sharing and privacy, e.g. via federated learning
* Interpretable AI/ML and Actionable Insights
* Ethical AI and accountability
* AI governance
* Regulatory aspects of AI in healthcare

Papers must be submitted in PDF format to easychair
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dshealth2022 and formatted according to
the new Standard ACM Conference Proceedings Template. Authors are encouraged to use the Overleaf template (https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-primary-article-template/wbvnghjbzwpc).
Papers must be a maximum length of 4 pages, excluding references.

The program committee will select the papers based on originality,
presentation, and technical quality for spotlight and/or poster presentation.

Selected papers will be invited to publish in Journal of Health Informatics Research (https://www.springer.com/journal/41666)
